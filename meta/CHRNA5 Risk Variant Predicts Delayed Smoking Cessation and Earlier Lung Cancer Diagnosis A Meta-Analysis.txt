               <p id="p-5">Tobacco smoking is one of the modifiable risk factors that most greatly contribute to cancer and many other severe medical
                  illnesses. Clear evidence demonstrates that genetic variation in the α5 nicotinic cholinergic receptor subunit gene <em>(CHRNA5</em>) is associated with heaviness of smoking and nicotine dependence (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>). A series of meta-analyses based on tens of thousands of subjects of European ancestry confirmed the association with smoking
                  quantity, defined by number of cigarettes smoked per day (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3–6</a>), with the most robust associations reported for rs16969968 and rs1051730, two highly correlated genetic variants (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>). The nonsynonymous variant rs16969968 results in an amino acid change in the α5 nicotinic cholinergic receptor subunit,
                  which alters nicotinic receptor conductance in vitro (<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>). These <em>CHRNA5</em> variants also are consistently associated with smoking-related disorders including lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary
                  disease (COPD) (<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9–11</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="p-6" class="indent">However, an important gap in our understanding of variation in <em>CHRNA5</em> is its contribution to smoking cessation. For example, these <em>CHRNA5</em> variants are less consistently associated with smoking cessation outcomes. Some studies show an association between the <em>CHRNA5</em> region and successful smoking cessation (<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12">12–18</a>), finding that the same risk variants that contribute to smoking quantity and nicotine dependence also predict smoking cessation.
                  Other studies, however, fail to confirm this association (<a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-19">19–21</a>). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of three treatment cohorts did not identify any nicotinic receptor genes as predictors
                  of prospectively measured smoking cessation (<a id="xref-ref-21-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">21</a>). Another large genome-wide association meta-analysis that strongly supported the association between 15q25.1 and smoking
                  quantity (<em>P</em> &lt; 10<sup>–32</sup>) reported a below GWAS-level association between <em>CHRNA5</em> and smoking cessation (<em>P</em> &lt; 10<sup>–4</sup>), defined as the contrast between current vs former smoking (<a id="xref-ref-5-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="p-7" class="indent">This gap in knowledge of the relation between <em>CHRNA5</em>, smoking cessation, and smoking-related disorders inspired this current research. We meta-analyzed results from 24 studies
                  of European ancestry in collaboration with the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and Genetic Associations and Mechanisms
                  in Oncology (GAME-ON) Consortia (Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung [TRICL] and Discovery, Biology, and Risk

                     <h3>Samples</h3>
                     <p id="p-8">In order to examine <em>CHRNA5</em>, age of smoking cessation, and age of lung cancer diagnoses, we invited studies in the ILCCO, the GAME-ON Consortia TRICL
                        and DRIVE, and the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDgene) Study. In addition, we included the Collaborative Genetic Study
                        of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) and three studies from the dbGap database: Atherosclerosis risk in Communities (ARIC), Multi-Ethnic
                        Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE). Results from 24 datasets (n = 29
                        072 unrelated smokers of European ancestry) contributed to the meta-analyses. Informed consent was obtained from participants,
                        and all studies received approval from the appropriate institutional review board. Standardized quality control measures were
                        applied to all studies. Of these datasets, seven were studies ascertained by conditions other than smoking-related diseases,
                        and 17 were studies of smoking-related diseases: lung cancer (15 studies), COPD (one study), and coronary heart disease (one
                        study). These different study designs allowed us to conduct stratified meta-analysis in patients ascertained for smoking-related
                        diseases and patients ascertained for other reasons. To be included in analyses, each patient was required to have reported
                        smoking cigarettes in his/her lifetime. Additional details for each dataset are provided in <a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jnci/djv100/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</a> and Supplementary Methods (available online). <a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jnci/djv100/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</a> shows the sample size, demographics, cigarettes per day, percentage of smokers who have quit smoking, and minor allele frequency

                        smoking among ever smokers, and 2) time (in years) from birth to age of lung cancer diagnosis among lung cancer cases. A secondary
                        phenotype defined as the duration from age of smoking onset (not available in all studies) to age of smoking cessation was
                        examined in a subset of studies. Smoking quantity when subjects smoked regularly was assessed with cigarettes smoked per day
                        (CPD), defined as a four-level ordered trait (CPD≤10; 11≤CPD≤20; 21≤CPD≤30; CPD≥31, coded as 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively).

                     <p id="p-10">Because of its biological significance, we targeted the <em>CHRNA5</em> variant rs16969968 for association testing. The variant rs16969968 was available in all datasets except ARIC, MESA, and the
                        German study. To examine ARIC and MESA, we imputed the rs16969968 genotype based on 1000 Genomes (<a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/">http://www.1000genomes.org/</a>) for analyses. In addition, we used proxy variants (rs951266, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.98, in ARIC, and rs9788721, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.83, in MESA, r<sup>2</sup> estimated based on 1000 Genomes for the EUR samples including CEU, GBR, TSI, IBS, FIN) (<a id="xref-ref-22-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-22">22</a>,<a id="xref-ref-23-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-23">23</a>) for analyses and reached similar results. In the German study, imputed genotype was not available and we used a proxy variant
                        (rs1051730, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.99 estimated based on 1000 Genomes for the EUR samples) for analyses. In addition, we conducted the meta-analyses with
                        and without the German Studies and reached similar results.

                     <p id="p-11">In each dataset, we used Cox regression models to evaluate the association between rs16969968 and the two primary phenotypes
                        (age of smoking cessation among ever smokers, and age of lung cancer diagnosis among lung cancer case patients), and the secondary
                        phenotype of smoking duration. The assumption of proportionality was examined by several different approaches (plotting the
                        log(-log(survival) against log(time) for different groups, ASSESS statistics, and testing the interactions between the covariate
                        and time). There was a trend of decreasing genetic effects in the very old age group when the cancer incidence decreases.
                        When truncating after age 82.5 (1% of the sample), the proportionality assumption was verified while all results were similar
                        with/without the truncation. Age as a continuous variable and sex were included as covariates. Additional covariates included
                        cigarettes smoked per day (a continuous variable). Genotypes were coded additively as the number of minor alleles (A), where
                        the reference allele was defined as the major allele (G) in the European ancestry population (<a id="xref-ref-24-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-24">24</a>). Consistency of allelic coding was confirmed by comparing allele labels and frequencies across datasets (<a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jnci/djv100/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</a>, available online).

                        studies, analyses were performed at Washington University as individual level data was provided for data pooling. Results
                        were returned to Washington University for quality checks and meta-analyses. Individual SNP analyses were performed using
                        SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

The R package, rmeta, was used to confirm results and generate meta-analysis plots (<a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a>). The heterogeneity across studies was assessed with the Cochran Q test and reported for each analysis. There was evidence
                        of heterogeneity across datasets for analyses of age of smoking cessation, but not for the analyses of age at lung cancer
                        diagnosis. This heterogeneity may be because of the varying study designs and ascertainment strategies. We report results
                        from random effects models for all meta-analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided,

                     <p id="p-15">Among smokers in the studies not ascertained for smoking-related illnesses, the rs16969968 risk allele (A) was associated
                        with a lower likelihood of smoking cessation, adjusted for age and sex. The meta-analysis across seven datasets resulted in
                        a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95 (95% CI = 0.91 to 0.98, <em>P</em> = .0042, <em>P</em>
                        <sub>heterogeneity</sub> = .32). In addition, we examined this association in subjects who were control patients in studies ascertained for smoking-related
                        illnesses. We saw a similar association in control participants in the studies of lung cancer with significant heterogeneity
                        across these studies (HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.87 to 1.02, <em>P</em> = .15, <em>P</em>
                        <sub>heterogeneity</sub> = .027). Non-statistically significant associations were found for control patients in the COPD and coronary heart disease
                        studies. <a id="xref-fig-1-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Figure 1</a> provides a forest plot summary for rs16969968 and age of quitting. The summary median age of smoking cessation was 56 years
                        for individuals with the high-risk genotype (AA), which was a four-year delay compared with individuals with the low-risk
                        genotype (GG), who had a summary median quit age of 52 years. At age 50 years, 42% of individuals with the AA genotype, compared
                        with 48% of individuals with the GG genotype, successfully quit smoking. In addition, rs16969968 was associated with delayed
                        cessation (n = 13 258, HR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.88 to 0.93, <em>P</em> = 1.93*10<sup>–5</sup>) in a pooled analysis using available individual-level data adjusted for age, sex, and study. These analyses were repeated
                        with smoking duration as the outcome, and similar results were seen.

                  <p id="p-22">This research shows a complex relation amongst smoking quantity, smoking cessation, genetic variation, and lung cancer risk.
                     We found that genetic variation in <em>CHRNA5</em>, which strongly predicts risk for nicotine dependence (<a id="xref-ref-3-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3–6</a>), lung cancer (<a id="xref-ref-9-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">11</a>), and COPD (<a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10">10</a>), also predicts delayed smoking cessation. The high-risk rs16969968 A allele is common in individuals of European ancestry
                     (42.5%, dbSNP CEU). Having the high-risk genotype (AA, 18% of European ancestry) was associated with a four-year delay in
                     median age of quitting smoking, compared with the low-risk genotype (GG, 33% of European ancestry) amongst individuals without
                     diagnosed smoking-related disease. This delay in quitting results in a longer exposure to carcinogens in cigarettes, which
                     predicts an increased risk for cancer, pulmonary, and cardiovascular disorders (<a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">27</a>,<a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-23" class="indent">Importantly, the <em>CHRNA5</em> variant rs16969968 also predicts an earlier diagnosis of lung cancer, manifested as a median age of lung cancer diagnosis
                     that is four years earlier in smokers with the high-risk genotype (AA) (61 years of age), compared with those with the low-risk
                     genotype (GG) (65 years of age), an association that remains after adjusting for smoking quantity. Lung cancer is the most
                     common cancer in the United States and worldwide and responsible for 13% of all lung cancer incidence and 27% of all cancer
                     deaths (<a id="xref-ref-29-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-29">29</a>,<a id="xref-ref-30-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-30">30</a>). The survival rate with a lung cancer diagnosis is low—50% die within a year of diagnosis and the five-year survival rate
                     is 16.6% (<a id="xref-ref-31-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-31">31</a>). Most cases (90%) of lung cancer are attributable to smoking. The acceleration of lung cancer diagnosis in those with AA
                     genotypes (18% of ever smokers with lung cancer) by four years compared with those with GG genotypes (33%) can be clinically
                     significant given the high mortality following a diagnosis of lung cancer. This finding is consistent with the previous reports
                     of <em>CHRNA5</em> and earlier lung cancer diagnosis in a single study (by five years) (<a id="xref-ref-32-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-32">32</a>), and a meta-analysis of five studies (by 1.1 years, n = 3898) by Lips et al. (<a id="xref-ref-33-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-33">33</a>). The present study is a larger meta-analysis (15 studies, n = 7074), one overlapping study (Toronto study, n = 270) with
                     the report by Lips et al.

                  <p id="p-24" class="indent">The mechanisms underlying <em>CHRNA5</em>, age of smoking cessation, and age of lung cancer diagnosis are complex, and we attempted to summarize our results in <a id="xref-fig-3-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F3">Figure 3</a>. The mechanisms through which <em>CHRNA5</em> accelerates the age of onset of lung cancer likely involve multiple pathways, including an increased number of cigarettes
                     smoked (<a id="xref-ref-3-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3–6</a>), deeper inhalation of cigarettes leading to higher carcinogen exposure (<a id="xref-ref-34-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-34">34</a>,<a id="xref-ref-35-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-35">35</a>), and a delay in smoking cessation. This combination of risk factors could mediate the genetic effect, so that this one genetic
                     variant, rs16969968, is then associated with earlier diagnosis of lung cancer by four years.

                     the genetic association between <em>CHRNA5</em> and smoking cessation in smokers not ascertained with smoking-related disorders, a step forward in exploring the public health
                     significance of this genetic marker.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-27" class="indent">These findings can help us understand discrepancies in existing reports of this genetic locus and smoking cessation. Some
                     studies show a relation between <em>CHRNA5</em> and smoking cessation (<a id="xref-ref-12-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12">12–16</a>), whereas other studies do not (<a id="xref-ref-19-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-19">19–21</a>). We hypothesize that the expression of this genetic risk on cessation varies with several factors, such as developing a
                     smoking-related disease, use of cessation pharmacotherapy (<a id="xref-ref-18-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>), and environmental influences on smoking cessation such as partner smoking (<a id="xref-ref-36-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-36">36</a>). The effect of this genetic locus is seen most clearly in a sample where there is no smoking-related disorder, pharmacotherapy
                     use is rare, and strong environmental push for smoking cessation is present. In addition, we posit that <em>CHRNA5</em> risk alleles dispose individuals to early development of smoking-related disease and that disease development encourages
                     earlier quitting than would otherwise occur. This is why this genetic risk is more likely to be positively related to quitting
                     age amongst individuals without smoking-related disease vs those with such disease; amongst the latter group, the effect of
                     <em>CHRNA5</em> to delay quitting is offset by its effect of accelerating disease development, which in turn promotes quitting. Similarly,
                     use of cessation pharmacotherapy may reduce the relation of <em>CHRNA5</em> with quitting age because pharmacotherapy appears to blunt this genetic risk (<a id="xref-ref-18-4" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>). The heterogeneity among studies in this meta-analysis indicates the genetic risk association varies with potential moderators
                     for the genetic risk such as the impact of disease/symptom, cessation, medication use, and environmental risks.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-28" class="indent">These results should be interpreted in the context of multiple limitations. First, smoking cessation in the samples was self-reported
                     and not assessed using biochemical confirmation. However, research shows that self-report is a valid indicator of current
                     smoking, especially when there are no strong incentives to deceive (<a id="xref-ref-37-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-37">37</a>). Second, we examined age of smoking cessation as a primary phenotype. There is no evidence of association between rs16969968
                     and age of onset of smoking, and there is limited variation in age of onset for smoking (<a id="xref-ref-38-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-38">38</a>,<a id="xref-ref-39-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-39">39</a>). We also analyzed duration of smoking as the secondary outcome for a subset of studies with available information and found
                     similar results. Third, we could not test the effect of cessation treatment on age of quitting, as this information was not
                     available. We assume the use of medication is not common because the majority of smokers quit without medication in the general
                     population (<a id="xref-ref-40-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-40">40</a>). Fourth, this work analyzed only one genetic variant, and it is clear that multiple genes or variants contribute to smoking
                     cessation (<a id="xref-ref-41-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-41">41</a>). Fifth, we found the genetic effect of <em>CHRNA5</em> on earlier age of lung cancer diagnosis after adjusting for the effect of heavy smoking while there is potential residual
                     confounding because of the imprecise nature of self-reported smoking quantity information. Finally, this study included only
                     subjects of European ancestry.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-29" class="indent">Despite these limitations, this meta-analysis clarifies the clinical and public health significance of a robust common genetic
                     marker identified in genetic studies of nicotine dependence. We demonstrate that the <em>CHRNA5</em> variant rs16969968 is a marker of delayed smoking cessation. The median age of smoking cessation for those with the high-risk
                     variants (AA) at rs16969968 is 56 years vs 52 years for those with the low-risk variants (GG). Similarly, those with the high-risk
                     variants have a four-year-earlier age of lung cancer diagnosis (61 years) compared with those with the low-risk variants (65
                     years). Recent research has revealed that two prominent smoking-related risk factors for lung cancer are heavy smoking quantity
                     and late age of quitting smoking (<a id="xref-ref-28-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a>), and rs16969968 influences both risk factors. Moreover, the current research suggests the boundary conditions affecting
                     the relation between rs16969968 and cessation, suggesting that development of smoking-related disease obscures the manifestation
                     of this genetic risk. Early detection of lung cancer is important (<a id="xref-ref-42-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-42">42</a>), and these results suggest the potential use of a common genetic variant such as <em>CHRNA5</em> rs16969968 as a susceptibility marker for earlier lung cancer diagnosis.
