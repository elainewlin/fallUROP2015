                        considered the gold standard endpoint. However, the disadvantage of using OS as the endpoint is that it requires an extended
                        follow-up period. We sought to investigate whether disease-free survival (DFS) is a valid surrogate for OS in trials of adjuvant
                        chemotherapy for gastric cancer.

                     <p id="p-2"><strong>Methods</strong> The GASTRIC group initiated a meta-analysis of individual patient data collected in randomized clinical trials comparing
                        adjuvant chemotherapy vs surgery alone for patients with curatively resected gastric cancer. Surrogacy of DFS was assessed
                        through the correlation between the endpoints as well as through the correlation between the treatment effects on the endpoints.
                        External validation of the prediction based on DFS was also evaluated.

                        correlation coefficient between DFS and OS was 0.974 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.971 to 0.976). The coefficient of determination
                        between the treatment effects on DFS and on OS was as high as 0.964 (95% CI = 0.926 to 1.000), and the surrogate threshold
                        effect based on adjusted regression analysis was 0.92. In external validation, the six hazard ratios for OS predicted according
                        to DFS were in very good agreement with those actually observed for OS.

               <p id="p-5">Gastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in the world, affecting 989000 patients in 2008 (7.8% of all cancers)
                  (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>). The most effective treatment for localized disease is surgery, but even after curative resection, recurrence is noted in
                  more than half the cases of advanced-stage disease. This poor outcome has prompted major efforts to explore different adjuvant
                  therapies. However, over the last three decades, despite some successful large-scale trials (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2–5</a>), only modest improvement has been achieved in survival. Our group recently reported the results of a meta-analysis of individual
                  data that showed a lower risk of death with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy than with surgery alone (overall hazard ratio
                  [HR] =0.82; <em>P</em> &lt; .0001) (<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>). However, the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy is still far from satisfactory, and further investigation into more effective
                  treatments for patients with resectable gastric cancer is warranted.
               </p>
               <p id="p-6" class="indent">Historically, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate has typically been the most quoted metric for judging the success of a
                  particular treatment. This endpoint has the advantage of being simple to measure, easy to interpret, and clinically meaningful.
                  However, the main disadvantages of this endpoint are that it requires an extended follow-up period and its measurement is
                  potentially diluted by nonmalignant causes of death and therapies for recurrent/advanced disease.
               </p>
               <p id="p-7" class="indent">A reasonable candidate for a surrogate of OS in the adjuvant setting is disease-free survival (DFS), which is defined here
                  as the time to cancer recurrence, second cancer, or death from any cause. Recent meta-analyses have been used to validate
                  DFS as a surrogate for OS in other tumor types (<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>). If DFS could replace OS in the assessment of the efficacy of new treatments in clinical trials testing adjuvant treatment
                  for patients with curatively resected gastric cancer, the trial duration and costs would be reduced. We performed a comprehensive
                  meta-analysis of data from 3838 individual patients randomized in 17 trials on curatively resected gastric cancer; documented
                  DFS values, which were available for 3371 of the patients from 14 trials, were used to evaluate DFS as a surrogate endpoint
                  for OS.

IPD from all randomized trials comparing adjuvant chemotherapy with surgery alone for resectable gastric cancers were sought
                        electronically from MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the National Institutes of Health trial
                        registry (ClinicalTrials.gov). Trials were eligible if they were randomized, closed to patient accrual before 2004, and compared
                        any adjuvant therapy after curative resection with surgery alone.

                     <p id="p-9">The following data were requested for all individual patients included in all the trials: center, randomization date, treatment
                        allocated by randomization, date of last follow-up or death, survival status, cause of death (if applicable), relapse status,
                        and type and date of relapse if any. OS was defined as the time from randomization to all-cause death or the date of the last

                        after these time points. Because only durations (OS and DFS) and not dates were provided for two studies, the same individual
                        follow-up was used for all patients, irrespective of their actual accrual date. In this analysis, the number of observed events
                        is considerably lower than that in the analysis of patients followed-up to a common administrative censoring date. In the
                        latter case, analysis takes place 2, 3, or 4 years after the accrual of the last patients. Therefore, the first accrued patient
                        may have much longer follow-up.

                  <h2>Discussion</h2>
                  
                  <p id="p-39">Our results show a very tight individual-level association between DFS and OS (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.974;
                     95% CI = 0.971 to 0.976), indicating that in individual patients, DFS is highly predictive of OS. The strong correlation between
                     DFS and OS can be partly attributed to the short time from relapse to death in gastric cancer (median of &lt;12 months across
                     all the included trials). Further, 16% of all the analyzed patients died without documented relapse and, therefore, had the
                     same DFS and OS.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p-40" class="indent">We also found a very high trial-level association between the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on DFS and on OS, with <em>R</em>
                     <sup>2</sup> being almost 1, which indicates that almost all of the variability in the treatment effects on OS can be explained by the
                     treatment effects on DFS (<a id="xref-fig-1-4" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Figures 1</a> and <a id="xref-fig-3-6" class="xref-fig" href="#F3">3</a>). We constructed the prediction limits around the regression line, which accounts for the fact that the hazard ratios of
                     DFS and OS were estimated with errors. STE was found to be 0.92, thereby implying that a treatment producing an 8% or greater
                     hazard reduction for recurrence can be expected to produce a statistically significant hazard reduction for death. STE also
                     reflects the expected dilution of the treatment effect on OS as compared with the effect on DFS. With a reduced duration of
                     follow-up, a stronger effect on DFS was required to predict a statistically significant benefit over OS. This is partly because
                     of the loss of events due to the shorter period of observation. At 4 years, a hazard ratio of 0.74 was required. In case follow-up
                     was truncated at 2 or 3 years, STE could not be estimated. A fixed follow-up period was used in this sensitivity analysis
                     because the date of randomization was not available for all studies. In trials with an administrative censoring date common
                     to all patients, more events would be available at the intermediate time point, resulting in more precise estimates. We also
                     did not collect information on the treatment administered after recurrence. However, the median OS of the patients with advanced
                     gastric cancer treated with chemotherapy was 8.7 months in the GASTRIC database (<a id="xref-ref-31-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-31">31</a>), and the impact of chemotherapy on OS after relapse was not much greater than that of adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus the fact
                     that some patients received chemotherapy on relapse is not expected to have a major impact on our findings.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p-41" class="indent">In a future trial testing a new treatment for gastric cancer, interest would focus on predicting the effects on OS at some
                     time point (eg, 5 years), having observed the effects on DFS at an earlier time point. The results presented in <a id="xref-table-wrap-1-2" class="xref-table" href="#T1">Table 1</a> suggest that the measurement of DFS at 2 years may be too early to enable an accurate prediction of OS at 5 years. With very
                     early time points, only few DFS events are available, which may result in imprecise predictions; on the other hand, very late
                     time points are less useful because they are closer to the evaluation of the final endpoint. Making analysis at 3 or 4 years
                     would probably reduce the overall duration by about 15% to 30% if the accrual was short enough.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p-42" class="indent">Do the present results justify the use of DFS as a surrogate for OS in resectable gastric cancer? A large proportion of relapses
                     occurred before 3 years, and we found a strong correlation between the endpoints, both at the individual and trial levels.
                     Similar results have led to the adoption of the 3-year DFS as a surrogate for 5-year OS in evaluating new treatments for resectable
                     colon cancer (<a id="xref-ref-32-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-32">32</a>). Our results are based on fewer trials and smaller sample sizes, but they include a broader range of treatment options.
                     One may be interested in whether DFS would be a surrogate for OS for all studies independent of geography because it is well
                     known that there exists a large heterogeneity about the prognosis between Asian and non-Asian patients. In spite of the prognostic
                     heterogeneity between continents, there was no statistically significant heterogeneity about the treatment effects on OS and
                     on DFS between Asia and non-Asia trials (<a id="xref-ref-6-4" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>). In addition, the relationship between the hazard ratio for OS and the hazard ratio for DFS was also clearly consistent
                     throughout all trials. Therefore, we believe the use of DFS as a surrogate would be independent of the geography. Moreover,
                     we were able to use the published results of trials not included in our meta-analysis, as well as the IPD from two large trials,
                     as two independent validation sets. The hazard ratios fell within the prediction intervals for all six available trials (<a id="xref-table-wrap-2-7" class="xref-table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>). The results of the four trials with literature data only should, however, be interpreted with caution because they are
                     based on extracted summary statistics. The relationship between the treatment effect on DFS and that on OS, as established
                     in trials comparing adjuvant chemotherapy with surgery alone, seems to be verified for the chemoradiation trial, which implies
                     that our results might be applicable to more general adjuvant treatments with a curative intent.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p-43" class="indent">One should keep in mind the following limitations. Numerical computational issues may have slightly biased correlation estimates.
                     Subgroup analysis based on the baseline variables, including continents, could not be performed because of the small number
                     of trials. Similar to the case with interim analyses, follow-up after the analysis of the surrogate endpoint (DFS) is necessary
                     to determine the OS, safety, and post-relapse outcomes as well as to document the possible impact of postrelapse treatments
                     for advanced diseases. An important consideration is that we only investigated cytotoxic agents, and future trials investigating
                     agents with different mechanisms of actions, such as target therapy, will require separate validation of the surrogacy relation
                     before it is applied routinely.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p id="p-44" class="indent">In conclusion, the treatment effect on OS is largely predictable according to that on DFS; therefore, DFS can be used as a
                     primary endpoint for further clinical trials of adjuvant chemotherapies, thus reducing the duration by 15% to 30% and the
                     cost, depending on the planned follow-up, of these large-scale randomized trials.

                     INCa centralized all the databases and provided administrative and data management support. The sponsor has not participated
                     in the analysis and interpretation of the data, which were solely the responsibility of the writing committee. The sponsor
                     played no part in the preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript. The conclusions may not reflect the recommendations
                     of the INCa.
